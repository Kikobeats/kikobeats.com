Inside **cloud economy** we can found:

* [SaaS (Software as a Service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service): When the software is hosted and you pay for a subscription. "on-demand software" as well. Examples: Spotify, Gmail, Skype,...

* [PaaS (Platform as a Service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service): Provides you computing platforms which typically includes operating system, programming language execution environment, database, web server etc. Examples: Heroku, Openshift, Windows Azure... 

* [IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)](): Provides you the computing infrastructure, physical or (quite often) virtual machines and other resources like virtual-machine disk image library, block and file-based storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks. Examples: Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine,...

Also, take in consideration that the lower layers support the upper layers
