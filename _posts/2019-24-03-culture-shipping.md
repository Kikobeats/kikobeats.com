## Build Less

Do less than your competitors to beat them.

Change must be easy and cheap. Lower the cost of change by:

* Less features.
* Less options/preferences.
* Less people and corporate structure (software is easy, people are hard).
* Less software (each line of code needs to be maintained).

## Be Yourself

Smaller companies are closer to customers by default.

The leaner you are, the easier it is to change. Differentiate yourself from bigger companies by:

* Being personal and friendly.
* Hire the right customer, build something you can manage.
* Decide the little details so your customers don't have to.

## Make Opinionated Software

The best software has a vision: decide what your vision and run with it.

Build software for general concepts and encourage people to create their own software:

* Build software for yourself.
* Forget feature requests. Be consistent.
* Decisions are temporary so make the call and move on.

## Software is Never Done

* Later is eternal, now is fleeting.
* Working is better than perfect.
* Focus is better than features.
* Compatibility is better than purity.
* Simplicity is better than anything.
