Errors are frustating. In the tech culture, the errors are everywhere all time.

When you design a error situation, think _how_ the user feels under this context. A good error message should be:

- **Say what happened and why**.
- **Suggest a next step**.
- **Find the right tone**.

At the end of the day, errors are part of the product and the business culture for communicating something was wrong.

Try to communicate **what** and **why** is happening with the less information possible, removing the unnecessary information for the current user abstraction layer.

Always try to provide a point to get more information, making possible extend the context, specially if you are creating collaborative software.
