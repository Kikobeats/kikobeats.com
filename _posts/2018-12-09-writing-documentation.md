> You have to sell what it is you're building in your documentation. It's not just describing what it is and how to use it. It's about telling interesting stories. 
<cite>Rico Sta. Cruz</cite>

## Highlights

[](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/documentation-handbook){:.card-preview}

- **Write like a human, not a machine**: Don’t be afraid to be funny, creative, and a bit silly.
- **Write as simply as possible**: Simple words, short sentences, bulleted lists and/or numbered lists, concrete examples. 
- **Make easy to contribute**: Provide a simple way to anybody extend the documentation.
- **Illustrate with examples**: Add examples for your words, keep it up to date.
- **Connect your documentation**: Don’t write linearly, just hyperlink other sections for connecting content, all the time.
