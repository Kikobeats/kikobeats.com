Recently I'm interested in this aspects more than ever. Surely because more than ever programmer not is only programmer.

My first contact with this was thanks at **Sebastian Hermida** (*@sbastn*), author of the spanish podcast **[Basta ya de picar](http://www.bastayadepicar.com/)** (my discover of the year). In the chapter seven he talk about UX and modern design purpose. Of course not was my first contact with the design: I have some design concepts, but Sebastian drew my attention in a way I'd never imagined before. The design was no longer simple, it became something much more intuitive. I was excited.

## Case of study: CashCloud

I'm in a proyect called [Cashcloud](https://www.cashcloud.com). Is a App for improve a electronic mobile wallet. Something of Cashcloud advantages are:
 
* Send money to your friends for free.
* Request money for free e.g. to split the bill for a joint visit to the cinema.
* Facilitate your purchases in online shops or at retail outlets -
even for small amounts.
* Offline you can pay with the cashcloud NFC contactless sticker on 
all MasterCard PayPass terminals quickly, safely and without annoying delays.
(These terminals are already available in hundreds of shops).

Cashcloud can become a useful application, but first needs to improve *many* things.

### TODO's
* App is very slow, and crashes everything.
* App is not ready for different and high ppi devices.
* App design is outdated and broken. Need full redesign.
* Welcome tutorial appear EVER.
* Social integration are inefficient.
* Many emails notifications for anything operations (and mails no ready for Responsive Design)
* Many confuse views and forms.

In the next weeks I will try to improve the design and the user experience and hopefully learn something in the process about this.
