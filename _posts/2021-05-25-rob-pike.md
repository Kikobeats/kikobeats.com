**Rule 1**. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.

**Rule 2**. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
<cite>Tony Hoare</cite>

**Rule 3**. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)

**Rule 4**. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.

> When in doubt, use brute force.
<cite>Ken Thompson</cite>

**Rule 5**. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.

> Write stupid code that uses smart objects
<cite>A smart programmer</cite>
