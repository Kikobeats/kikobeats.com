## What's the point?

I found a clarifier comment about this topic in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13457437):

> If the structure of encoded data is guaranteed to be a flat list of name-value pairs, `x-www-form-urlencoded` seems sufficient. If the structure could be (arbitrarily) complex (e.g. nesting lists or associative arrays), then definitely use JSON.

And also:

> In your situation JSON/XML/whatever is extra costs in time, memory and CPU cycles. `x-www-form-urlencoded` data combine readability and compactness so I can bet it's your choice.

## The rule

First,  don't use more than you need. Keep it simple!

If you need send a form or plain object, then use `x-www-form-urlencoded`.
In other case use `application/json` (and you will have to stringify before send and parse after send).
