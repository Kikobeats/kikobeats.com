Based on my experience, a *good name* for a project should be check the major part of the list:

- Short and easy to pronounce in English.
- Evident is better than clever. Also better for SEO.
- Naming should be evokes an action with the product.
- Keep in mind alphabetical position can be an advantage.
- Think in the copy and synonymous words.
