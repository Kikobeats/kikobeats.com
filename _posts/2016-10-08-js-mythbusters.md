Recently I run the website [JS MythBusters](https://mythbusters.js.org). The idea behind the site is **perfomance matters**. 

I wanted to collect tiny and useful perfomance tips for the day a day, but not too specific or low level: Just a set a good practices that you can take in consideration in your development workflow.

I don't want write assembler code in JavaScript; If I can write something using different ways, I want to know what is best and why.

For example, one of my favorite that can be a real impact in the perfomance of your architecture is simply [how to create timestamps](https://mythbusters.js.org/date/timestamp.html).

One of the thing that I put effort was the **community factor**: every tip have a comment box. Could be possible that you think that the tip is not actually true, so you can comment about it. Also provided the source as [bibliography](https://mythbusters.js.org/bibliography.html).

I'm happy how it's working. Next step is [have a logo](https://github.com/Kikobeats/js-mythbusters/issues/31). ðŸ˜„
