> Low value activities keep you busy and stop you from getting real work done. Make time for work that matters.

## Things that improve your productivity

- Ability to separate urgent but low and important tasks has a lot to do with your success. **Low-value work is necessary but not important**.

- **Schedule less time for low-value tasks**. Don't feed things that are non productive for you. Avoid the busy work that add no real value to your work, vision or long-term goal.

- **Automatize all the things**. Do not do it too early, but detect the pattern and foresee when it is necessary.

- **Priorize your short and long term goals**. Make very focused lists for things to accomplish each year, each month, and each day.

- **Do something attainable, realistic, and time-bound each day** aligned with your long-term goal. Generate the momentum of getting things done.

- **Delegating is key**. Share responsibility. Everyone is more productive when they are doing what they like, and do what you would want other people to do for you.

## Things that reduce your productivity

- **Responding to notifications** will not contribute to your goal of the day. Put down your phone and kill those notifications.

- **Limit the times you check the mail**. Check it 77 times a day is totally unnecessary. 3 times each day is enough.

- **Resist the tyranny of the urgent**. Your ability to distinguish urgent and important tasks has a lot to do with your success.

- **Careful with multitasking**. You can probably do two things at once, but not more.

- **Say no**. You don't need that. You don't want that. Thanks, but no thanks.
