I started this summer trying something concepts and modifying the [Sails core](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) and finally I launch my own open source project.

During this time I was in the [Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp in Barcelona](http://www.ironhack.com/) because I won the [RITSI Challenge](http://kikobeats.com/risti-challenge-ironhack), but now is time to back at home.

The new academic year going to start in the [University of Murcia](http://www.um.es/web/english/). I feel like Harry Potter when Hogwarts starts again after the summer.

I learned a lot in Ironhack and I have some offers around Barcelona, but I feel that first I have to finish my academic education.

This year is a little different because I'm going to specify my Computer Science bachellor in Technology of the information (most known as *networks*).

Really I'm interesting in work remotely. I like the idea of the [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad) and to be honest I would like to work sails team. [Integrate my project with the core](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/pull/2083) and crafting software together. *Time to time*.

I remember that I decided write in english to improve myself, and, still need to improve, but now is much better. *gz Kiko!*

So, I have some challenges for the next months. The education, the job, and others projects that I want to launch in few time. Really Sailor is the master key to launch project in fast mode.

Back home and see old friend is the best part. Finally [these](https://speakerdeck.com/kikobeats/sailor-components-in-the-backend) are the slides that resume sailor project.
