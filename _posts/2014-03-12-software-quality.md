>When people say "this sucks" they mean one or more of the following:

- This doesn't do what I need.
- I can't figure out how to do what I need.
- This is unnecessarily frustrating and complex
- This breaks all the time.
- It's so ugly I want to vomit just so I have something prettier to look at.
- It doesn't map to my understanding of the universe.
- I'm thinking about the tool, instead of my work.
