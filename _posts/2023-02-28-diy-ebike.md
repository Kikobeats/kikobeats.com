I wanted to build an e-bike that:

- easy to modify.
- feel robust and secure. 
- can be used as legal in Europe. 
- with components that are easy to replace. 

This blog post details all the technical aspects while I learn about electricity and how an e-bike works.

## Aesthetic

![](/images/diy-ebike/ebike00.jpg)

I wanted a style between [café racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_racer) and [scrambler](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambler_(moto)). There are some e-bikes in the market in this line, such as [Super73](https://super73.com/) or [P-51](https://p51bikes.com/). I took them as inspiration. 

## Legality

![](/images/diy-ebike/ebike06.jpg)

It's going to be [legal in EU](https://www.emesa-m30.es/legislacion-bicicletas-electricas-espana/) if you don't:

- Don't Excess 25 km/h.
- Don't have a throttle.
- Total weight is less than 40kg.
- The motor only works if you pedal first.

## Lights

Most of the e-bike lights are boring. I want to feel Mad Max during the night. I wanted something special, so I built something custom from motorcycle parts:

- Front: [15 LED Headlight](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004690586273.html).
- Rear: [LED Tail Light](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33060150281.html) + [DC to DC converter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001621898311.html).

## Accesories

As much accesories as you can carry in your handlebar:

- Bell: [Minimalistic inspired by Knog Oi Classic Bike Bell](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005592755053.html).
- Mudguard: [Super73 RX fenders](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004798581797.html).
- Handlebar mirrors: [CNC Handle Bar Mirrors](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001027234703.html).

## Security

I will usually keep the bike close to me, but it never hurts to be cautious:

- [A hidden Apple Tag](https://www.apple.com/es/airtag/).
- [KryptoLok Standard With Flex](https://www.kryptonitelock.com/en/products/product-information/current-key/001966.html).

## Tyres

![](/images/diy-ebike/ebike13.jpg)

I'm using [Vee Mission Command](https://eu.super73.com/products/mission-command-tire), and I think they are the best in the budget quality/price/aesthetic, also offering a good mix of compose for all terrains.

Vee also [Huntsman](https://veetireco.com/product/junior-specialty-e-huntsman-sold-as-a-pair/) model oriented for e-bikes, and although they [look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYBKZTHklTg) great, they are 20% heavier.

## Suspensions

![](/images/diy-ebike/ebike10.jpg)

The frame I got has a pretty decent supension:

- Front: [KKE BF-34CS](http://www.kkeracing.com.cn/id-36.html?t=en-us)
- Rear: [KKE BA-27RC](http://www.kkeracing.com.cn/id-31.html?t=en-us)

If you want to save money, having just front suspension is probably okay, especially with these wide tires.

## Controller

![](/images/diy-ebike/ktcontroller.jpg)

The controller chosen is a KT-25A sine wave controller purchased at [JN Ebike Store](https://jnebike.aliexpress.com/). These controllers are cheap, well-tested, and easy to find. Also they offer waterproof wires.

The KT-25A is rated for a 750W motor. My current motor is 1500W. I experienced that the maximum power delivered on my e-bike is around 1000W.

Ideally, I should to upgrade to one bigger (around 35A). I bought a [KT 50A Controller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005304649417.html) (because it was cheap), but first, I would have to adapt the wires. Someday, I will, but not today. I have enough good for day-to-day.

## Display

![](/images/diy-ebike/ebike11.jpg)

The display is a KT-LCD8HU bought at [JN Ebike Store](https://jnebike.aliexpress.com/).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sVwDGJp05AA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

These displays are designed to be paired with KT controllers. There are different variations. One great thing about this color display is it allows tuning some parameters related to the motor.

## Motor

![](/images/diy-ebike/ebike09.jpg)

The motor is also designed to be paired with a KT controller. In this case, the motor is a 1500W that fits in a fat rear cassette tyres. I bought it at [JN Ebike Store](https://jnebike.aliexpress.com/).

## Frame

![](/images/diy-ebike/frame-1.jpg)

I wanted a frame that feels robust on the road. After much research, I found [marioebike](https://marioebike.en.alibaba.com/) was selling a frame pretty near what I wanted to achieve.

![](/images/diy-ebike/frame-2.jpg)

After I got it and chatted often with Brownie Wang, they finally designed another one with double suspension and a bit smaller.

## Battery

![](/images/diy-ebike/battery.jpg)

My battery specs are 52V17.5Ah.

The max power my battery can deliver is **52V * 17.5Ah = 910 watt-hours (Wh)**

If we estimate 1 mile costs about 20 Wh, we can estimate the battery range as:

**910 Wh / 20 Wh = 45.5 miles = 73 kms**

Conversely, the battery wattage directly relates to how much power it can deliver to the bike.

Note although the motor supports 1500W, the battery pack can deliver around 1000W. Expect an upgrade in the future.

I've [tuned](https://www.radowners.com/index.php?topic=741.0) controller settings to work with 52v properly.
