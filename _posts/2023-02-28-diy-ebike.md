I wanted to build an ebike that:

- Be feel robust and secure. 
- Be useful for low speed. 
- Components are easy to replace. 
- Can be used as legal in Europe. 
- Should be easy to limit and delimit.

This blog post detailing all the technical aspects while I learn about electricity and how ebike works.

## Legality

![](/images/diy-ebike/ebike06.jpg)

It's going to be [legal in EU](https://www.emesa-m30.es/legislacion-bicicletas-electricas-espana/) if you don't:

- Don't have a throttle.
- Don't Excess 25 km/h.
- Motor doesn't work if you don't pedal first.
- Total weight is less than 40kg.

## Lights

- Front: [15 LED Headlight](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004690586273.html).
- Rear: [LED Tail Light](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33060150281.html) + [DC to DC converter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001621898311.html).

## Accesories

- Bell: [Minimalistic inspired by Knog Oi Classic Bike Bell](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005592755053.html).
- Mudguard: [Universal Monkey M3](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003642322059.html) + [Super73 RX fenders](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004798581797.html).

## Security

- An Apple Tag.
- Kryptonite kryptolok Standard W/Flex Cable.

## Tyres

I'm using [Vee Mission Command](https://eu.super73.com/products/mission-command-tire), and I think they are the best in the budget quality/price/aesthetic, also offering a good mix of compose for all terrains.

Vee also [Huntsman](https://veetireco.com/product/junior-specialty-e-huntsman-sold-as-a-pair/) model oriented for ebikes, and although they [look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYBKZTHklTg) great, they are 20% heavier.

## Suspensions

- Front: [KKE BF-34CS](http://www.kkeracing.com.cn/id-36.html?t=en-us)
- Rear: [KKE BA-27RC](http://www.kkeracing.com.cn/id-31.html?t=en-us)

## Controller

The controller is a KT-25A sine wave controller bought at [JN Ebike Store](https://jnebike.aliexpress.com/).

That controller is rated for a 750W motor. My current motor is 1500W.

That only influences into the delivered power, meaning the controller can't deliver all the power the motor can handle.

Ideally, I should to upgrade to one bigger (around 35A). I bought a [KT 50A Controller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005304649417.html) (beacause it was cheap) but I have to adapt the wires. Some day, it isn't urgent.

## Display

The display is a KT-LCD8HU bought at [JN Ebike Store](https://jnebike.aliexpress.com/).

It has a color display with USB because of course I'm a geek.

## Motor

The motor is a 1500W fat tire rear casette motor bought at [JN Ebike Store](https://jnebike.aliexpress.com/).

## Frame

I wanted a frame that feels solid with some cafe racing style, and I found [marioebike](https://marioebike.en.alibaba.com/) were selling a frame pretty near to what I wanted to achieve:

After got it and chatted often with Brownie Wang, they finally designed another one with double suspension and a bit smaller:

## Batery

My battery specs are 52V17.5Ah.

The max power my battery can deliver is **52V * 17.5Ah = 910 watt-hours (Wh)**

If we estimate 1 mile costs about 20 Wh, we can estimate the battery range as:

**910 Wh / 20 Wh = 45.5 miles = 73 kms**

On the other side, the battery wattage is direclty related into how much power it can deliver to the bike.

Note although the motor supports 1500W, the battery pack just can deliver around 1000W. Expect an upgrade in the future.

I've [tuned](https://www.radowners.com/index.php?topic=741.0) controller settings to work with 52v properly.  

## Wishlist
