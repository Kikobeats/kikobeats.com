[Fusion Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_Drive) is a Apple technology for make a logic unit like [RAID 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_0) combining a traditional HDD and a SSD. You can the advantage of both: The system distribute the information that you use with more frequently in the SDD because you need feel that works fast, and also have too storage.


But the very nice of this is that is transparency for you transparency for you.

If you are interested in make a Fusion Drive, you only need the hardware, an backup ([Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/) is a very nice for this) and typical terminal commands create the new logic unit.

[This](http://www.verschoren.com/blog/2013/8/19/mavericks-and-fusion-drive) is a nice guide about the process.

Also remember use [Trim Enabler](http://www.cindori.org/software/trimenabler/) or similar software to activate TRIM cache system for your SSD.
