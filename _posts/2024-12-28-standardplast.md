I want to apply some [standardplast](https://standartplast.com/) products over my car to improve heat insulation and sound proofing.

After spending some time understanding the different products, these are the best products on my opinion.

## Why STP

Although they are more brands in the market, STP are easy to get:

- They are in many countries.
- They have YouTube channels in different languages explaining how to install them.
- The product, overall, is very good.

## Products

- [STP Black Silver](https://standartplast.com/es/catalog/silver-line/stp-black-silver/): 1.8mm vibration damping and sound proofing.
- [STP Black Gold](https://standartplast.com/es/catalog/gold-line/stp-black-gold/): silver but 2.3mm.
- [STP Aero](https://standartplast.com/es/catalog/diamond-line/stp-aero/): It's Aero gold, but [expensive](https://resonixsoundsolutions.com/resources/what-is-the-best-sound-deadening-material-independent-testing-data), not worth it.
- [STP Accent](https://standartplast.com/es/catalog/gold-line/stp-accent/): 6mm/10mm heat insoluation & vibration dumping
- [STP NoiseBlock](https://standartplast.com/es/catalog/gold-line/stp-noiseblock/): 2mm sound insulation.

## Installation

It's expected combine different products for getting better overall performance.

A commonn combination in layers is: aero silver/gold + aero accent + noise block.

There is a complete [instructions](https://standartplast.com/es/instructions/doors/) section in the website.

## Aerocell QP

There is a new lineup of products claiming to combine a sandwich in line layer (15 in 1), reducing the cost.

There are two options: 

- Genio: 6mm for interior floor, interior doors or front wheel arches.
- Intrigo: 4mm for roof, hood, trunk, exerior doors, etc.

According with a distributor, it's better than combine Aero + Accent.
